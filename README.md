## Test endpoints with Postman

Test this application endpoints with Postman:

- [Download it](https://www.getpostman.com/)
- Start it and import `SkipTD_JavaChallange.postman_collection.json` which is a collection of example requests.

## Persistence layer

For this project I used MySQL. Since I am also using an ORM solution (Hibernate) it could be switched to another database solution with no major issues. But, also, have a sample using pure JDBC: `ProductDAOJDBCSampleImpl.java`
